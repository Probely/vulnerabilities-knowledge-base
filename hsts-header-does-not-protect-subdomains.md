The application is setting the `Strict-Transport-Security` header but with an insecure value, specifically without the `includeSubdomains` option. 
The `includeSubdomains` option will extend the benefit of the header to the subdomains, preventing situations where the attacker registers (or takes over) a subdomain and leverages that read session cookies from the parent domain.

## How to fix

{% tabs hsts-header-does-not-protect-subdomains %}
{% tab hsts-header-does-not-protect-subdomains generic %}
The application should set the `Strict-Transport-Security` header with secure values. You just need to add the `includeSubdomains` option.

A secure header will look like this:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000;includeSubdomains 
```

With the option `includeSubdomains`, all requests to URLs in the current domain and subdomains will go over HTTPS. When you set `includeSubdomains` make sure you can serve all requests over HTTPS! It is, however, important that you add the option `includeSubdomains` whenever is possible.
