A Server-side JavaScript injection vulnerability allows the attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript code on the server. Web Applications that pass user input to functions like `eval()`, `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` are potentially vulnerable.

The impact of this vulnerability ranges from an effective denial-of-service attack to File System access on the server.

## How to fix

{% tabs server-side-javascript-injection %}
{% tab server-side-javascript-injection generic %}
To prevent a Server-side JavaScript injection vulnerability, you should validate all user input on the server-side before processing. 

You should also consider the following:
* Do not use the `eval()` function to parse user inputs. 
* If you need to parse JSON input, use a safer alternative such as `JSON.parse()`.
* Include ```"use strict";``` at the beginning of a function.
